# Project Structure

The Biruni Project is organized into three primary layers:

1. **Frontend**: Developed using AngularJS.
2. **Application Server**: Built with Spring, it acts as a gateway between the frontend and the backend, providing various utility services such as report generation, integration, notifications, and file processing.
3. **Backend and Database**: Implemented in Oracle using PL/SQL, housing most of the project's architecture and framework logic.
